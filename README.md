# CubeItMod

Tool for convert BFB File from KISSlicer - PRO To Cubex 3D printing
Project coded in Auto-It.



I'm working of a new version of CubeItMod.
Planned for work from 1.5 Beta 1.17 to current version (1.5 Beta 2.20)

For the moment only the parsing of the header's data into a variable/value work.
